The easiest to use Google Fonts Typography Plugin. No coding required. 900+ font choices.

== Description ==
The [Google Fonts](https://fontsplugin.com/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=intro) library currently contains 877 unique fonts. This plugin allows you to easily use any of them on your WordPress website.

You're not stuck with one font for the entire website, you can easily choose one font for headings and another for your content.

It's hard to know which font will look good on your website, that's why we've included a live preview feature. That means you can test each font and see a live preview of how it will look with your content instantly.

Once you've found a combination you love, you can press save and make the changes publicly visible.

The full Google Fonts library can be found here - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
